# Lab 1 Practice

### Practice Programs

1. `sum.c`  
   Write a program to create an array of N integer elements. Find out
   the summation and store it in another variable and print it on the
   console. Use Dynamic Memory Allocation.

2. `palindrome.c`  
   Write a program to check if a given string is pallindrome or not.

3. `student.c`  
   Create a structure for a student database having different variables,
   such as student_name, age, roll_no and address. Use this structure
   in your program to store the infomration about you and then print it
   on the console. Rewrite the above program by taking the student_name 
   and address as character pointers. Use Dynamic Memory Allocation.
