# Lab 2

Write a C++ program to implement a time class.
It has private hours, minutes, and seconds data members.
There are two options to create a clock namely,

1. Create  
2. Create and Set Time

Creation option calls a default constructor that sets all the private members to 0.
The second option gets the hour, minutes, and seconds value from the user;
creates, and calls a default constructor to initialize all private data members.
A destructor is called to destroy the memory allocated to time class objects once they go out of scope.

The program has the following Menu: 
1. Set Time
2. Print Standard Time (AM or PM)
3. Print Universal Time (24 hours)
4. Print Indian Start Time (24 hours)
5. Print Pacific Standard Time (AM or PM)
6. Exit

Maintain proper boundary conditions and follow coding best practices.
